    <p>
We're in part five today of a series called Adam's Family as we look at the first family in the Bible to see what we can learn from them. You know Joel Osteen says before he preaches, he says, I like to start with something funny. 


That's him. I liked to be funny throughout the message. He said I'd like to star with some funny, you know what I just you don't I like the start where I can start off with my theme music. So we are Zion music Hit it with that. 


Genesis chapter three, let's get into the word of God. Genesis Chapter three we're going back to Adam's family. If you have a Bible and you wanna follow along in yours, I'm going Genesis three one to seven, one the seven. 


And if you are physically able to stand with me as I read this passage, please do so. If can do it without harm to yourself. While you're standing, tell somebody, I am glad you made it to church today. 


We'll be done around three. Now I know why y 'all come to this service. You don't want to rush anyway, but amen. Let's go. Genesis chapter three, verse one. I'm using the easy English Bible today. I like this. 


Listen to what it says beginning in verse one, the Lord God made many wild animals, But the snake was the most clever of them all. The snake asked a woman, did God say you must not eat the fruit from any tree in the God? 


Is that really true? The woman replied, we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden. Verse three, but God said, you must not eat from the tree that is in the middle of the Garden. You must not even touch it. 


If you do that, you will die. Verse four, then the snake said to the woman, no, you ain't gonna die, you're not serious. Verse five, God knows that when you eat the fruit from this tree, you will understand things. 
 <h2>Dated: 23th December 2024</h2>
 <p>
Yeah, you would become like God himself. You will know about good things and evil things are six. The woman looked at the fruit on the tree. She saw that it was would be good to eat. It was beautiful to look at you fine. 


She wanted to eat it because it would give her something she didn't have. I can't go into that this week. That's next week is just Your deficiencies makes you vulnerable to certain things That ain't for this weak. 


I'm all in the next weeks. So she took some of the fruit and she ate it And she gave some to her husband who was with her He also ate Didn't he understood what they had done? They realized that they were not wearing any clothes So they took some leaves from fig trees, they tied them together to cover their bodies. 


I'm gonna stop right there. Before you're seated, let me give you my subject. I was preaching today from the subject, temptationology. You may be seated. The book of Genesis, particularly the story of Adam and his family, introduced to us a series of firsts. 


The first marriage. They are literally the first family. We see in their story, the first offering in chapter four, the act of domestic violence happened in this family. We the see the temptation in his family, the spiritual warfare as Satan showed up in the form of a snake and trapped them. 


It's a bunch of firsts, but now I wanna make several observations in these passages today that are centered around temptation. That's why I'm calling this message temptationology. Whenever I don't know what to call something, I just put ology on the end of the word and that just makes it sound fancy. 


The first observation I wanna give to you is, first of all, whatever patterns that we see, and there are patterns in this temptation that the devil uses on Adam and Eve that are similar to the patterns he uses with us. 


This whole purpose of studying this story is to see what we can learn. What can we learn? the first move he made was to reduce God, to bring God down, to dethrone the goodness of God. Because if I'm gonna bring, if i'ma bring god's child down and I gotta start by bringing the parent down.

If I can minimize in your mind how much you reverence God I have then started the process of deceiving you and luring you into disobeying God, because since he's no longer high and lifted up, how does he do it? 


Look at how he does it. The first move he makes is, is he made God look stingy. He says in verse one, he said, hey Eve, never said anything to Adam. He said to the woman, did God say, y 'all can't eat all this? 


Y'' all got all his food in this garden. Put the garden up for me. That's the garden of Eden. It's like I just, it's what we call it, the garden. Y 'all can't have all that. You mean you serve a God that's not generous? 


Yet this ain't all y' all can eat. This ain' t all you can eat? Say it ain', so Eve, you must be playing. You means God is that stingy that he's, watch this, he is withholding something from y 'all? What kind of God is that? 


See, one of Satan's movies is to make us, what gets us tempted is when we think that God has not already given us his best. God, is holding something back from you. He doesn't want you to have his best, in fact, because not only is it strategic, it worked. 


It worked, I'll prove it to you, look at how she responds in verses two and three. Her First response was she starts talking about the Liberty that she and Adam has now when she talks about The Liberty did they have she never mentions God she said we can eat from the trees in the garden But when he talked about restriction and prohibition she mentioned God Look at it verse 2. 


She says we couldn't eat for this reason to God verse 3, but God say it But God said please wake up the person next to you elbow. Do not miss this part She starts off talking about their liberty and being at it. 


We can eat from the trees into God But God says you cannot eat for this one. He you right mr. Snake He is stingy He has put boundaries on us She focuses on the prohibition of God. She doesn't even say at this point with Genesis 2 16 says God said you can need of all the streets in the God just not this One she didn't mean to mention God at all or all the things she said we can eat from the trees of the God but he said God says in verse 3 we cannot eat this tree and we cant touch it. 

</p>

Cap. That's cap. God never said you can't touch. He has already reduced who God is down in her mind so much. She said, we couldn't even touch out here. We're going to die. Look at the move he puts on Eve to reduce her opinion of God. 


That is the start of temptation. Ladies and gentlemen, God has not given me everything. There's more out here for me And it makes you ungrateful watch this not only is God that generous, but it also makes me un grateful for the blessings He's already given. 


Me who stay with me now. So he's all ready gathered trap. You can stick a fork in her right now She's, already done because once you once You look at God is not being good to you and you start minimizing the blessing that you have You are now prepared for what Satan wants to put in the menu for you Cuz God is not gonna give you everything and you don't appreciate what you got You wide open for whatever Satan's gonna bring your way. 


How many people tracking with me right now? So watch this now that he's reduced God. Here's the second move the Second move I brought God down by making them seem stingy. He won't even let y 'all eat everything What kind of gods they want to let you let your eat? 


Everything second thing He says is watch. This God can't be trusted in verse 4 She said, we're going to die here if we do anything. We even touch the tree. He said yeah, first of all, I know God told you all that, but God, watch this. 


He questions the veracity and word of God. Ooh, how many of you grew up in a Christian home or in the spiritual environment where people taught you right from wrong? How many ever grew in that environment, right? 


Watch this, have you ever noticed that when you You knew it was wrong, you were taught it was it wrong. It was clear that it's wrong When you started doing it, do you ever remember there was a time you say, I'm not even sure this is even wrong?

Who am I talking to the wrong church here? Do you understand what I am saying? You had the first start coming, did God really say I can't do this till I get married? He couldn't have meant that. What would you see in your faces? 


What the devil, these are not new moves. All the devil has to do is say, nah, I don't need to make sense. This is the real world we're talking about. First of all, you ain't gonna die. God's lying. Now he is a chief liar, and he's calling God a liar. 


He the best that ever did it, or the worst that never did. And he called God, a lawyer. So he brings God reputation down to makes her distrust his word. By the way, by the parenthetically, this is good peace right here. 


Because one of the things that gets missed in there is the work the devil is doing on this marriage. The divisiveness between Adam and Eve can be overlooked if we don't pay attention. Because Satan is having a conversation that is fully focused on Eve, and Adam according to verse six is right there the whole time. 


So he dismisses her husband and is havin' a conversations with her that excludes him. And she doesn't include him, and a lot of your marriages are in trouble is because you're having conversations that don't include your spouse. 


Somebody say the power of agreement. The power agreement is very important in marriage. That's why a lot of people get attacked. We get attack and we get vulnerable because we got one person in the marriage making decisions on behalf of both people and the other person didn't have any say in it. 


So now we gotta deal with the consequences. Eve made a decision y 'all that Adam did not approve of That impacted both of them. That's a fact. You don't have to like it. That is a FACT. She did something. 


And this is the thing. Whenever you are going to make a decision in your relationship and it affects both of y 'all, it is unkind and disrespectful to not include your spouse. Especially when you're about to make the decision that you already both agree that we're not going to do this or we are gonna do this, you changed the rules and didn't include me. 


Ooh, yall ain't ready for this today. How did you get to isolate? I thought it was we you're still acting like it's just me See what the difficulty in marriage is is that people are supposed to walk into a we ology You're, still operating both of you in with me ollogy And as long as you agree with, me we can, do this you disagree me i'm gonna do it anyway So eve is having a conversation with somebody she doesn't know, who she's talking to She knows it is a snake, but she, doesn' t know satan is moving through the snake everything is making sense to her yes Satan you right mr. 


snake God is holding stuff for me and yeah you write I really could use some wisdom I don't have what this tree is offering that makes sense me she sees no threat in this conversation and she doesn't defer to or refer to her husband in the situation she takes the lead and leads them both down a path of destruction. 


Never once saying, honey, do you think we should do this? It makes sense to me. See, why do I bring this up? A whole lot of people listening to because I know God wouldn't have gave me this if it wasn't. 


Whole lot of the people listen to Me are in marriages and relationships where there's a dominant person in the relationship that makes all the decisions for the relationship and the family. And the other person doesn't get to raise their mouth or open their mouth because you're not spiritual enough. 


Now, this sounds to Eve like it's light. It sounds like its right, but it actually lies. Because Satan didn't walk up to Eve and say, hey I'm the devil, I came to kill the still and destroy. I come to sift you like wheat. 


He doesn't do that. he comes like light, he's an angel of light so it makes sense when he comes to us. But you have nobody to vet it against. So because you get to hear from God and you think it is God, you run your family down one rabbit hole after another because You don't have a mate that can speak up and veto what you're making the family do or y 'all ain't ready for me today I'm gonna tell it all the day This is the problem So this person you you in a marriage where you just go go along get along go alone and get alone Because because they all they got to do is say God said this and then they trump everything you feel or trump Everything you say oh, you know, there's this this doesn't you can't give any pushback to this but but what happens is then they get to quit their job spend all the money start a business and everybody goes down they Get to relocate you to a place where you have no family support because they heard from God You can't play space with your friends no more. 


You don't get the go to family events anymore You cannot be around certain family because if they hurt from god And I'm saying at some point you got to stand up and open up your mouth and just say nah. 


I don t think this right I am not going for this. I don't think this is fair. We got in this marriage together and listen to you have to understand God gives you a life's mate to stop you from doing stuff. 


That's stupid I'm gonna say that again. God. Gives you your life mate the stop. You're doing something stupid. It's not it's restriction its protection If somebody needs the authority to be able to say in a relationship, hey, I am an equal partner I want to co -air with Christ with you. 


I need to stay I won't agree with this and no I Don't have Bible for it. Oh, no the Bible like you I don't know them scriptures like you. I ain't got no scripture for it And I know and I can't get no I didn't getting no quicker than and ain got No, he Kurt or Shonda ain' got none of that I think he wake me up at 3 in the morning because he know I gotta get up for work in The morning I aint got nothing, but this what I no I knew it don' sound right and i know it. 


Don't feel right, and like I'm not supporting it Who am I talking to here if you know you no? When one person makes all the decisions in a relationship that's a dangerous relationship, particularly when the person thinks they're getting light. 


I'm not saying you're intentionally running your family down the hole, I am saying you think you are getting life. Sometimes you need to go to counseling and go to some spiritual authority and say, is this the right thing? 


We're not on the same page about this. Can you help us out? Just because you mad don't mean you right. I said just because you man don t mean right, but just cause you feel strongly about it doesn't mean that you re right you can feel strong about and still be wrong. 


And just because somebody won't go along with you don't mean they're bucking you Every time my wife didn't Go along, with me i thought she was buckin me I've been trying to start a church forever She was i don' think it's time under you you support me you'll support, me By the way in 1990 when this started Every church i was trying, to get into i ain't know, she, was basically praying against it She didn't even want it to happen. 


I was trying to get in any way. I wanted to pass to any church. It could be 3rd Baptist, 4th Presbyterian. I ain't care. I just wanted, I'm just wanting to preach at one place every week. That was protection. 


I saw it as rejection, but it was for protection the whole time. Because even though she didn t know, and I didn no, I don't know Zion Church was coming. I did not know this was come in. I do not fit in at any other church, but this church if I had got in one of them churches, I would have had to wear one in them outfits and collars on Sunday and walk around and bow and do all that stuff with candles. 


I done lost who I am. God had to protect me so I can get to y 'all because I fit yall. This fits me. So I apologize. Let me go back to this story. So look at verse five. So he's already got her thinking God's not generous and God don't even keep his word. 


So, look in verse 5. He says, this is why you should do this Eve. Now watch this. The whole conversation is the Eve Remember, he's trying to exclude Adam. He starts off with talking to the woman in verse one, the whole conversations with the women. 


She tries to include Adam briefly in verse two, she said, we can eat the trees, but look at how it goes right back to Eve, verse four, go back the verse for, no, you will not die. But when you eat Eve from this tree, Evie, you will understand things. 


You will become like God himself. Eve, you know about good things, Eve. This is your moment. This your time. And watch this, watch, this is all focused on her, but they're all empty promises because she did die. 


They would have never died had they not done this. They were never supposed to die, and not only did she not find herself on a parv equality with God, she found herself hiding in the bushes, naked in a shame. 


Because let me tell you my third point. Temptation will always over promise and always under deliver. It always, over promises and under delivers. That's what somebody wants to say, a temptation will take you further than you want to go, keep you longer than want you to stay, and cost you more than what you wanna pay. 


And isn't it interesting, isn�t it too interesting that the temptation, the two most important temptations in all the history was over food. Jesus was tempted in Luke 4 and Matthew 4 over foods. And Adam and Eve attempted over food and it's always a temptation to eat something we're supposed to do. 


Devil said turn these stones, eat these stone. You ain't supposed to use stones. you're not supposed eat forbidden fruit. I have never been tempted to eat something I wasn't supposed to. I've never been tempted to be some I was supposed eat I'm supposed say I have always tempted to some, I am not supposed eat. 
</p>

So if Jesus was tempted with food and Adam and Eve were tempted with the food, it stands to reason that you and I are going to be tempted. With food. And we're my fat people that I don't need to really I need talk to somebody. 


How many people understand you get tempted with food. It's like, we here. We is here! I rebuke every skinny person in here in the name of Jesus because you ain't even skinny. You just got good genes. 


That's all. You ain' t about that life. Then when we're tempted with food, when, it's cold in there, then when we tipped it with foods, um it always, it promises comfort. Steve is like it is going to comfort you. 


But then after you eat it, you don't feel comforted. You feel bad and ashamed. Just like Adam and Eve, negative and a shame, hiding in the bush. Yeah, he's trying to hide. I don t even want to know what I just did. 


Because it always over promises and it's always under delivers. It always feigns to give you something that it can never give to you." Let me go to verse six and I'm done. I want to show you something. 


I'm gonna call this my last one. It's called a temptation grid I wanna show something out of verse 6 that I call the temptation. Temptation grid. This is where we're gonna close a T temptation is like this temptation starts with something that captures our attention now when you look at verse six The Bible says the woman started looking at the fruit on the tree. 


They caught her eye So it always starts with something that catches our eye. But then it says she looked at the fruit, but then verse the next part of verse, then she saw it it would be good to eat. She's looking and she's singing. 


The fact that she sawed it would good eat means she must have looked at it longer. When you stare at something, it's one thing to see something say, whoa. But when you follow it, when you go look it up, now it moves from attention to what I call preoccupation. 


So now, it didn't just cross my eyes. Now it's on my mind. You stay on my mine. So, she says, so it would be good to eat, and it is beautiful, like, ooh, it's beautiful, and whatever you are preoccupied with, eventually it moves from preoccupation, from attention to pre -occupations to getting your affection. 


Because now, watch this, now I don't just want you in my mind, I want you in my heart, and it is a whole different level when you want something in your mind than when you want something in your heart. 


Look at her. She says, I want that. Because it's going to give me what I'm missing. And whenever what you're missing intersects with what he's offering, you trapped. You see this? I'll talk next week about what we're going do with this. 


But this is what's happening in verse six. This is happening. She's moving from attention and caught her eye. Now it is on her mind. She's preoccupied with it and anything you're preoccupied longer. Well enough with will get you Whether you secretly pre -occupied wit it or shamelessly pre occupied you out in the open with It's gonna get ya because here's the deal. 


Here's a deal Temptation is connected to taste. Look at two things. She says she says in her mind It is good to eat and it's beautiful to look at watch this It's good to eat, and it's beautiful to look at. 


Those are the two qualifications for a temptation. It must be pleasurable, and It Must Be Attractive. And it has got to be pleasure and attractive to you. If it is not pleasurable and attracted to You, It is Not a Temptation. 


We can stack it up right here, and I won't even bother you, but if it was pleasuable or attractive you we are going to have to take you out of here in a group. To keep, you understand what I am saying? 


See, temptation is wiring oriented. it. And everybody has something that tempts them. See, do you ever, and that's why it's stupid to judge somebody for the things that attempt them just because those things don't tempt you. 


Because temptation is wiring oriented. See something might tempt me, you might think I'm crazy for being tempted to that. Something might tip you, I might I think you're disgusting. But the truth of the matter is all of us are tempted based on how we're wired. 


Have you every had somebody say they enjoy something, certain foods, certain restaurants, certain movies, certain places, and you couldn't stand it. It's like some trash. Like every time I go with somebody, they order oysters. 


I'm like, what is your problem, man? How could you even put that in your body? Taste. Everybody say taste. All of us got taste, and the devil knows your tastes. Now you can sit in church and act like you ain't got no taste You got a taste because let me tell you something. 


we all got a dark side. Temptation triggers our dark side, let me talk the land over because I know they got the dark side over there because i know you leave pass. If you know, you got to dark sides just put your hand up, you've got something that's temptable and triggerable, trigger -able. 


That's your dark, side everybody's got our darkside. Everybody's, got, something about them that you're not pleased with. In fact, Here's the thing. Let me talk to singles for a minute because see what Adam and Eve They got married the day they met That's not good to do and God put that together. 


I don't think you should do it that fast Because there were dark sides about them that never came up until this moment See pressure brings out the dark side Yeah, you know say I'm saying that's what that what this does see their things about see you have to understand that Adam and Eve had dark sides and when you're single, let me make a humble suggestion I suggest that while you are getting to know your love interest and all of their strengths and all the honorable things about them, don't miss the dark side Like you need to find out. 


I ain't saying make the Dark Side come out Just life on them enough to where you don' t miss it because it's there Now if you save see some of us darkside doesn't pop out enough because the Holy Ghost got it all compressed we're my compressed dark people if let me say something if it wasn't for the Lord you would see darkness on the regular with some of us am I right I know y 'all look see they look up in here and they look at me and think cuz we up here that we ain't dark let me tell you something this pulpit area is just one step from the pew and the We came from the pew to the pulpit. 


What does that tell you? I ain't but two steps back to streets. I'ma tell ya that right now. I am wild. Get me two step wrong and you will see me someplace you would never had imagined in all your life with my saves. 


Everybody got a dark side. So the thing is, is to discover it because it ain' going anywhere. It's called total depravity. It' something that the divine human nature don't even take away. You got saved and it's still there. 


So you got to understand that it is there, not so you can lead a person, but so that you could observe. Say, oh, okay. Okay. So, you're just going to roll rage. No, no, just you going tailgate this person for half an hour. 


I didn't know you were that petty. You don't even say it out loud, you say, hmm, I had no idea you were that slick. You really are deceitful. I have no ideas you are that selfish. You are selfish, and I didn't know. 


I knew it not. I'm not saying it's a deal breaker, because everybody got a dark side. You got to decide what you can live with They say you know what I all this time. I thought you was an introvert You're in an inch of vert People don't like you I Thought you like being alone nobody likes to be around you cuz of your character I didn't know See you gotta think that I'm not saying the relationship was over because Adam and Eve had dark sides and God put them together You are not gonna find somebody darkness You got to find out what kind of dark I can live with in light of all the other characteristics of the person. 


So you can get with this, but if you're going to be a racist, you going have to get with something, and it's going be dark. Because Adam and Eve didn't know what the dark things were about each other. 


See, y 'all done said, when Adam saw Eve doing this it had to blow him. Because this tree wasn't new to Adam. Adam had been around this trees since back in chapter two before Eve showed up. He already knew what the boundary was and never messed with the tree Now he's watching Eve and she's talking to a snake and actually not only contemplating eating a tree She actually took the fruit and ate it and I'm sure Adam was like Shawty you Wow You what you're Wow Joe, oh man ain't no he was wild like that It was already there he just hadn't seen it And she had a takeover spirit. 


You took over, you were sent to this world to protect me and to support me, and they helped me. And to be my helpmate. Now you're running our family. That was in you too. So y 'all don't like this, but it was there all the time. 


The pressure boarded out yall. You should see yalls faces. So I didn't know you were like that. But guess what? Eve didn' t know how he was. He got a dark side too, So he says, you're wild. She said, yeah, and you weak. 


I didn't know you were weak like that because let me tell you what Adam did. Eve didn' t know that Adam would turn on her like that. Not only turn her on, but turn her over to the authorities. Oh, y 'all don't that? 


I'm all in the next week. Let me tell ya something. When God confronted Adam about this, I wish yall read the Bible. God never brought Eve's name up. God had an APB out on Adam. And every question was to Adam, Adam where are you? 


Adam who told you you was naked? Adam did you eat what I told not to eat? God never bought Adam but never bought Eve up Adam bought her up! When God confronted Adam all Adam had to say yes Lord I did it. 


I was wrong it's my fault I shouldn't have did it Adam never took responsibility. His first response was the woman you gave me you talk about first this Bama's the first snitch this dude turned states evidence on his wife with no hesitation you know what he said that's his dark side that says dark sigh you don't you say long as everything good ain't no trouble you cool we cool it's cool we get in trouble I'm gonna show you my darkside here's my darkside I never take responsibility for the things I do wrong. 

<h2>Date: 24th December 2024</h2>
<p>

Whenever something goes wrong I'm a victim. Oh y 'all don't know nobody like that do you? I am a victim I never own my stuff. It's always an excuse for what I'd do. When you do it it's wrong when I do I was just tired. 


Y 'ALL ain't ready for me today. That's that dark side. And it was in both of them before they met. So Adam said you wow you weak. I ain t know you I ain't know you would do that. That's why I'm telling you singles, you better figure it out. 


This might be information you wanna know. Say, you know, I kinda knew this going in. And let me tell you how to get to it. I'll finish with this. Let me show you to how get that dark side. First of all, it always comes out under pressure. 


You can't fake under depression. You gotta see what they like when they're angry. I mean, real angry, not even the name praising the Lord when they cussing. When they don't get their way, expectations, everybody's got a dark side. 


So it comes out under pressure. But let me tell you another way. You ready? Here's another secret to getting to the darkside. Pay attention to what they joke about. Take notes on the jokes. Stay woke on jokes, that's bars. 


Stay woken on them jokes because more truth is said in jest than in any other thing. time. So watch this. When a person tells a joke about something, what they're doing is they are unintentionally enlightening you into their dark side. 


So when they always make jokes about money, What they trying to tell you is I'm irresponsible with money. Well, I'll do anything to get it. You got to don't skip the jokes. Don't When a person always have flirtatious jokes, what they're trying to tell you is, I'm a freak. 


This brother handcuffs here. When the person jokes about their mental health, what are they trying, they are not even trying to you, they aren't intentionally exposing that which is dark. Do you all understand what I am saying? 


You better stay woke on them jokes. And here's another way. Here's an other way sometimes. They don't even joke they throw it out there What'd you think about? bankruptcy Yeah, I know people are getting bankrupt what they're doing is no I'm serious y 'all yall It's we're too far of a service for your life. 


You can't laugh too long When somebody throws something out they what you thing about this or that What they trying to do is is to fill you out to see how you'll react because what every human being wants to know is, is my dark side safe with you? 


I worked so hard to hide it and because you only looked at my posts online which are very screened and polished and selective and you never asked the people in my past, what's the dark side? I'm doing the best I can not to ever let you see it. 


Oh, I'm gonna stop right there. That's a good part to stop on. I'll stop right then. Now I gave you, there's, a lot today. There's a life to think about, but here's what you do. Ask God, Lord, what am I supposed to take away from this message? 


One thing, just don't try to, all, one thing. What's my one takeaway? That Paul said, this one thing I do. David says, one think I've got a side of the Lord, that will I seek after. What the one thank God that I'm supposed to do with this? 


Because I don't want you to be just good sermon listeners. We gotta be good word livers. Because if it doesn't translate in our lives, we're good, we just wasted gas and time. You don' get credit for hearing, you get credit for heating and obeying. 


Are you understand what I'm saying? Let's pray. Thank you for your word, Lord. Thank You for this day and this moment, this opportunity. We pray that You would help us to know what to apply to our lives specifically from this truth, from this word from, this message, show us how to apply it and give us the grace and the strength to do it. 


We thank you in advance for it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen
